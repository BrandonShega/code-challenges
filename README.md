* Make sure your function name is `<YourName><ChallengeName>Solution(…)`
* Go to `<ChallengeName>Tests.swift`
* add `func test<YourName>` function. Look at the other ones to see how.
* Run the project using the “Test” Run (press and hold on Run on the top left to see it)

* Once you’re ready, send a pull request
  * If you need to update your pull request, just push to your forked branch
